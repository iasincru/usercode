Hello!

The script in this folder makes BOOKLETS of EPS Plots, which
come out of the TopSVDFunctions-Code.

The plots are arranged, so that plots with a similar message
are aligned together.

Example: All Response Matrices from all channels and systematics
are put in one TeX-File. 

Usage: In the file ./Steering/steering.steer you give 4 lines for
each booklet:

(1) The Extension of the EPS Plot with which the Filename ends.
    If this is 'Unfolding_combined_Leptons_Eta_HAD_InputDataGenRec.eps', 
    then this should be 'InputDataGenRec'.
    Note, that his extension will also be the name of the Tex/PDF file.

(2) Whether this plot should be printed for the nominal sample or not

(3) Whether this plot should be pribted for a systematic or not

(4) A descriptive title

The file is read successively, blank lines are ignored.

In the head of the executable 'make_CP_booklet.sh' there are more
hardcoded steering options, such as

- The output folder to use

- the names of the systematics  to loop over

- the channels to loop over

- the distributions to loop over (note, that this list is devided
  distribute it over two pages)

- whether EPS should be converted to PDF first ( in case you want
  to use pdflatex)

- whether the image files should be copied to a subdirectory of
  where the tex-file is

- whether the tex files should be automatically compiled or not
  (only plain latex)

Have fun with it.

David
